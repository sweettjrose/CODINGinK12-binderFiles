    "This is running on a Google Compute Engine server on a distant planet and deletes what you've done after 20 minutes of inactivity. To save for later use or analysis you have a few options:\n",
    "- File > Download as > ipynb (to continue your analysis later)\n",

    "This notebook was created by Physics teacher and Quarknet member Peter Apps, York Middle/High School, Retsof, NY, and modified by Adam LaMee. Find more activities and license info at [CODINGinK12.org](http://www.codingink12.org). The data come from the [USGS earthquakes page](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/csv.php). And thanks to the great folks at [MyBinder.org](https://beta.mybinder.org/) this notebook is interactive without you needing to download it or install Jupyter on your own device."
